# SurveyBox iOS App
#
> SurveyBox is a lightweight, cloud-based mobile application that will allow users to create, view and share surveys to their targeted audience. Users can create survey templates from scratch and also use premade survey templates to fit their needs. Both types of templates are completely customizable to allow creators to retrieve all the necessary data in gathering requirements from their audience. Non-users are allowed to view surveys and fill them out, while members are allowed to create a profile that saves the history for every form that has been created, filled or are currently in use. Metrics will be provided along with the history for the creator of that particular survey.
